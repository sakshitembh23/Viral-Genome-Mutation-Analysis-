Investigating Colistin Resistance in Bacteria
🧪 Project Overview
This project aims to identify the gene(s) responsible for colistin resistance in bacteria by analyzing a plasmid DNA sequence. Colistin, a last-resort antibiotic, has seen rising resistance, posing serious public health threats. Using bioinformatics tools like ORF Finder, BLAST, and Jalview, the project investigates gene prediction, functional annotation, and evolutionary conservation of resistance genes across bacterial strains.

📌 Problem Statement
Scientists discovered a bacterial isolate resistant to colistin in an animal farm. Plasmid DNA from the isolate was sequenced, and the challenge was to identify any gene conferring colistin resistance, specifically through analysis of open reading frames (ORFs) and their protein products.

🛠️ Tools & Methodology
🔹 ORF Finder
Tool used: NCBI ORF Finder

Parameters:

Genetic Code 11 (Bacterial)

Min ORF length: 150 nt

Excluded nested ORFs

Output: 30 ORFs identified (only those with ≥95 amino acids were analyzed further)

🔹 BLASTp
Compared ORF-predicted protein sequences against UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database

Parameters:

E-value: 0.01

Max target sequences: 100

Word size: 6

Matrix: BLOSUM90

Purpose: Confirm protein-coding potential and annotate protein function

🔹 Functional Annotation
Matched accession numbers to UniProt entries

Focused on identifying polymyxin resistance proteins (e.g., EptA, PmrC)

🔹 BLASTn & MSA
Used BLASTn with the PmrC gene sequence to identify similar resistance genes in other bacterial genomes

Performed multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using Jalview

Analyzed nucleotide and amino acid variations across bacterial strains

🧬 Key Findings
Identified Phosphoethanolamine transferase EptA / Polymyxin resistance protein PmrC as the likely gene responsible for colistin resistance.

Protein modifies lipid A in the bacterial membrane, reducing its negative charge to confer resistance.

BLASTn analysis revealed similar genes in E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains.

MSA revealed significant nucleotide and amino acid variations, notably at:

Position 937 (Isoleucine → Valine)

Position 993 (A → T; transversion mutation)

🧠 Biological Significance
Understanding resistance mechanisms like that of PmrC provides insight into:

Antibiotic resistance evolution

Potential molecular targets for future therapeutics

Surveillance of resistance gene spread via plasmids
